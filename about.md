I'm Vinnie and this is something I've been wanting to do for a while.  This blog is developed using Jekyll and is hosted on Github.  For the past 15 years, I've been working with data and databases at organizations large and small.  I really enjoy working with the Microsoft Data Platform, but also really just like working with interesting people trying to solve problems.

With any luck, the inforamtion that I'm posting on this site will be useful to a few people.  I make no promises about how often it'll be updated, or the nature of the subject matter.
